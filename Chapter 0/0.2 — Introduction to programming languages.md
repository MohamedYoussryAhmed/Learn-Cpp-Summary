### 0.2 — Introduction to programming languages
---

### Intro

- Computers must be told exactly what to do.
- The process of creating a program is called **programming**
  - A set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task
  - **source code** (commonly shortened to code), is a list of commands typed into one or more text files.
- When a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction, this is called running or **executing the program**.

### Machine Language
- The limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly is called machine code 
  - Here is a sample machine language instruction: **10110000 01100001**
- each instruction is composed of a sequence of 1s and 0s. Each individual 0 or 1 is called a binary digit, or bit for short
- The number of bits that make up a single command vary -- for example, some CPUs process instructions that are always 32 bits long, whereas some other CPUs (such as the x86/x64 family, which you are likely using) have instructions that can be a variable length.
- This meant programs generally weren’t portable (usable without major rework) to different types of system, and had to be written all over again.

### Assembly Language
- In an assembly language, each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation (rather than a set of bits), and names and other numbers can be used.
  - Here is the same instruction as above in assembly language: **mov al, 061h**
- This makes assembly much easier to read and write than machine language. However, the CPU can not understand assembly language directly. Instead, the assembly program must be translated into machine language before it can be executed by the computer.
- This is done by using a program called an **assembler**. Programs written in assembly languages tend to be very fast, and assembly is still used today when speed is critical.
- First, assembly languages still require a lot of instructions to do even simple tasks.
- Second, assembly language still isn’t very portable.

### High-level Languages
- To address the readability and portability concerns, new programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, others were developed. These languages are called **high level languages**
- they are designed to allow the programmer to write programs without having to be as concerned about what kind of computer the program will be run on.
  - Here is the same instruction as above in C/C++: **a = 97;**
- programs written in high level languages must be translated into a format the computer can understand before they can be run

#### Compiler
- compiler is a program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable 
- in the beginning, compilers were primitive and produced slow, unoptimized code. However, over the years, compilers have become very good at producing fast, optimized code.

#### Interpreter
- An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.
- first. Interpreters tend to be more flexible than compilers, but are less efficient when running programs because the interpreting process needs to be done every time the program is run.
- This also means the interpreter must be installed on every machine where an interpreted program will be run.

### Conclusion

- First, high level languages are much easier to read and write
- Second, high level languages require fewer instructions
-  In C++ you can do something like `a = b * 2 + 5;` in one line. In assembly language, this would take 5 or 6 different instructions.
- Third, programs can be compiled (or interpreted) for many different systems, and you don’t have to change the program to run on different CPUs
- There are two general exceptions to portability.
  - The first is that many operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, contain platform-specific capabilities that you can use in your code. These can make it much easier to write a program for a specific operating system, but at the expense of portability. 
  - The second is that some compilers also support compiler-specific extensions

### Rules, Best practices, and warnings

#### Rule
> Rules are instructions that you must do, as required by the language. Failure to abide by a rule will generally result in your program not working.


#### Best practice
> Best practices are things that you should do, because that way of doing things is either conventional (idiomatic) or recommended. That is, either everybody does it that way (and if you do otherwise, you’ll be doing something people don’t expect), or it is superior to the alternatives.


#### Warning
> Warnings are things that you should not do, because they will generally lead to unexpected results.
