### 0.1 — Introduction to these tutorials
---

#### Welcome!
- these tutorials don’t assume you have any prior programming experience
- lots of examples along the way.


---

#### Lesson structure
- aimed at giving you some context around what C++ is, how it came about, how programs work, and what software you need to install to create your own programs.
- Further chapters will explore different parts


---

#### Goals
- you will not only know how to program in C++, you will know how NOT to program in C++, which is arguably as important.
- provide plenty of clear, concise examples to show the application of concepts you are learning.
- Provide practice programs after many lessons and sections


---

#### Getting the most out of these tutorials
- Type in the examples by hand and compile them yourself
- Try to solve your own problems before asking others for help, Learning how to find and fix errors is a key skill to successful programming.
- Experiment with the examples, Modify the programs to do additional things,  Try to find different ways to break the programs
- Write your own short programs using the concepts you have learned.
